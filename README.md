# SE_AGIt looks like you've provided a Streamlit application code that utilizes the LangChain library for expanding or condensing articles to a specific word count using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. Below, I've provided a basic README for this code:

# Article Expansion/Condensation App using LangChain and GPT-3.5

This Streamlit application allows users to modify the length of an article to a desired word count using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model through the LangChain library.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the required packages using the following command:
   ```
   pip install streamlit langchain
   ```

2. Replace the placeholders in the `articleModifier` function with actual values:
   - `model`: Replace with the appropriate GPT-3.5 model variant.
   - `temperature`: Adjust as needed to control the randomness of responses.

3. Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
   ```
   streamlit run your_app_file_name.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. Enter the article text in the provided text area.
2. Enter the desired word count in the text input field.
3. Click the "Expand/Condense" button.
4. The app will display the expanded or condensed article based on the given word count.

## Note

- Make sure to have an OpenAI API key and set it up properly in your LangChain configuration, if required.
- This application uses Streamlit for the user interface and LangChain for interacting with GPT-3.5.
